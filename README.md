# Musical Album Rater
Musical Album Rater is a way to rate official album releases of an artist/band. It utilizes the Musicbrainz
API to search for an artist/band return its country of origin and various genre tags. Official releases are
then filtered from bootlegs etc to the DOM with functionality to rate the albums on a scale of 1-5 then
sort the rated albums in a separate list.

## Installation
Open index.html in browser of choice.


## Usage
Enter band name in and hit ‘Search’. Once albums are listed, rating drop down is generate next to each
album. If desired, an option below this new list is generated to sort the albums from highest to lowest
rating.


## Future Plans
POST a snapshot of a list of album ratings. In the future the user can re-rate the album and see how their
personal taste has changed over time.
